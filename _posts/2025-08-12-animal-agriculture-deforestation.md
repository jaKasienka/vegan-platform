title: "How Animal Agriculture Fuels Deforestation"
---

Animal agriculture is a leading driver of deforestation worldwide.  
Forests are cleared to grow crops â€” not to feed people, but to **feed livestock**.

**The facts:**
- Over **80% of global farmland** is used for livestock and their feed, yet provides **<20% of calories**.
- In the Amazon, **most deforested land** ends up as cattle pasture.
- Forest loss releases carbon, kills biodiversity, and displaces Indigenous communities.

**What could change:**  
If the world shifted to plant-based diets, we could free vast areas of land to **rewild habitats**, **restore ecosystems**, and **slow climate change** through natural carbon capture.
