title: "Why Cows Don’t “Just Give” Milk"
---

Many people believe cows naturally produce milk all the time.  
The truth is: **like all mammals, cows only make milk after giving birth**.

**In the dairy industry:**
- Cows are repeatedly impregnated to keep milk production constant.
- Calves are taken from their mothers within hours or days, so the milk can be sold.
- Both mother and calf suffer — emotionally and physically.

**Why it matters:**  
This cycle is hidden from public view, but it’s the foundation of modern dairy production.  
Knowing the truth helps us make choices that align with compassion and reality.
