title: "What Happens the Day After We Go Vegan?"
---

Imagine if the world chose plant-based food overnight.  
The changes would be immediate â€” and powerful.

**Day 1:**
- Billions of animals would no longer be bred for slaughter.
- Feed-crop demand would plummet, slowing deforestation.
- Water use and greenhouse gas emissions would start dropping.

**Year 1 and beyond:**
- Factory farms and slaughterhouses would close as systems transition.
- Restored land could be **rewilded**, capturing carbon and reviving ecosystems.
- The cultural narrative would shift toward **compassion** as a shared value.
