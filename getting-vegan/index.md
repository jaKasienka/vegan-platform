Free Me is about compassion, sustainability, and freedom — for animals, people, and the planet. Going vegan is one of the most powerful steps you can take. Whether you’re just curious or ready to fully commit, here’s everything you need to know to start your journey.


### Why Vegan?

Veganism means choosing not to use animals for food, clothing, or entertainment. It’s not about restriction — it’s about aligning your daily choices with kindness, health, and a more sustainable world.

Every plant-based meal saves lives, reduces emissions, and makes the world a little better.


### Food Basics

- Eat the rainbow: fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds.

- Replace animal products:

    - Milk → oat, soy, almond, rice, coconut.

    - Cheese → vegan cheeses, nutritional yeast.

    - Meat → beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, jackfruit.

    - Eggs → flax or chia “eggs,” aquafaba, silken tofu.

- Protein sources: lentils, chickpeas, beans, tofu, tempeh, seitan, nuts, seeds.

- Omega-3s: flax, chia, hemp, walnuts, algae supplements.


### Health & Nutrition

- **Vitamin B12**: take a supplement or use fortified foods — non-negotiable.

- **Vitamin D**: sunshine or supplements (especially in winter).

- **Iron**: beans, lentils, spinach + vitamin C (like lemon juice) for absorption.

- **Calcium**: fortified plant milks, tofu, leafy greens, almonds.

- **Iodine**: iodized salt or seaweed.

- **Zinc**: legumes, pumpkin seeds, oats, cashews.

Vegan diets can be incredibly healthy — but like all diets, balance is key.


### Everyday Tips

- Start with meals you already love and veganize them.

- Read labels (watch for milk powder, gelatin, whey).

- Batch cook staples: beans, grains, sauces.

- Keep snacks handy: fruit, hummus, nuts, energy bars.

- Explore recipe blogs and apps (Minimalist Baker, Forks Over Knives, Bosh!).


### Eating Out

- Many cuisines are naturally vegan-friendly: Indian, Middle Eastern, Ethiopian, Mexican, Asian.

- At restaurants, ask for “no meat, no dairy” — most places will help.

- Big chains often have vegan options or “hacks.”


### Beyond Food

Veganism goes further than diet:

- **Clothing**: avoid leather, wool, silk, down, fur → choose plant or synthetic fabrics.

- **Cosmetics & cleaning**: look for vegan and cruelty-free labels.

- **Entertainment**: avoid supporting industries that exploit animals (circuses, marine parks, zoos, transport, sports).


### Contribution & Activism

- Sign and share petitions — you can find some on the About page of this website.

- Volunteer with animal rights or environmental groups.

- Support vegan businesses.

- Speak with kindness: veganism is about compassion, not perfection.


### Final Note

You don’t have to be perfect. Every choice counts. Even one plant-based meal is a step toward freedom — for animals and for yourself.

**Free them. Free yourself.** 🌱
